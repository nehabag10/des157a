    <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
    <div class="info">
    <p>Looking through the <a href="https://tjda.jp/">Taijuyamashita Design and Architecture</a> page helped me explore combining interactions and images in a unique way. For example, on the title page, I found it interesting that the individual displayed previous of their projects in an carousel that was running without user interaction and got faster when the user scrolled over the images. I really enjoyed how the images were not only on the auto-carousel but also showed portions of the image or had embedded transitions in the previews. This provided a different and dynamic experience displaying more portions of same picture at different times. It was more inviting for me to explore each one of those project and further understand the story. When clicking on these projects, there is a minimal use of words so the images are the spotlight and can communicate the message clearly. The images also show variety in close up and larger spaces which draws attention to different details when looking at the images. Including interactions that prompt the image to fill the screen when the user hovers over it is also a great way to observe the detail of the space easily.

        <h2>Reflection: Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes        </h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p>Overlays can be useful to convey information but it is important to use it in the right and effective ways. The information in the overlay is slightly more visible than the background and lies within a content box. There are three main considerations to keep in mind when using overlays: make sure it is keyboard friendly, there is a way to easily exit the overlay, and the overlay is distinctly different from its background. The main goals of an overlay is to to get users to see content, finish a form, or make decisions. It’s also important to keep in mind that overlays don’t distract from the goal of a page. To avoid getting in the way, overlays often are used in the introductory instructions so it isn’t an interruption. An overlay should also in the direct line of vision for a user so it catches their attention immediately. Another important consideration is how these overlays are visible on mobile devices and taking considerations into account to still make overlays effective.

        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p>After reading the article, I was able to reflect on my experiences with filling out forms. I realized myself appreciating accepts in forms that are mentioned in this list because they aided usability throughout the form and motivated me to reach the completion of the form. There are different components within several of the practices that stood out to me as they each served a different purpose in keeping the user’s attention and engagement. Following practices such as minimizing the number of input fields, following a one column layout, signaling the multiple steps within a form through a progress bar, and asking easy question first are all different ways to maintain the attention of users. These practices make it easy for initial hurdles for the user to be avoided and incentivize them to go through the entire form.</p>
             
         <p class="para2"> In my experiences with forms, seeing my progress within the form has incentivized to continue filling it out because I was aware of the end goal and is a practice I follow when making forms.Other features such as distinguishing optional versus required fields, providing formatting requirements, and label placement all provide clear notations and directions within a form to avoid confusion. Confusion is another popular reason by individuals don’t end up filling out forms. Other practices I’d like to highlight include the action button - the provide direction on the action being completed, form feedback - to prompt users where an error may exist, and minimizing drop down menus are other features I find useful when filling out forms.The <a href="https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/checkout">Old Navy</a> checkout form is one that I find easy to navigate because of the feedback I receive when interacting with portions of the form. It also follows the one column format and provides labels which make it easier to fill out the form.
