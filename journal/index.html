        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p>After reading the article, I was able to reflect on my experiences with filling out forms. I realized myself appreciating accepts in forms that are mentioned in this list because they aided usability throughout the form and motivated me to reach the completion of the form. There are different components within several of the practices that stood out to me as they each served a different purpose in keeping the user’s attention and engagement. Following practices such as minimizing the number of input fields, following a one column layout, signaling the multiple steps within a form through a progress bar, and asking easy question first are all different ways to maintain the attention of users. These practices make it easy for initial hurdles for the user to be avoided and incentivize them to go through the entire form.</p>
             
         <p class="para2"> In my experiences with forms, seeing my progress within the form has incentivized to continue filling it out because I was aware of the end goal and is a practice I follow when making forms.Other features such as distinguishing optional versus required fields, providing formatting requirements, and label placement all provide clear notations and directions within a form to avoid confusion. Confusion is another popular reason by individuals don’t end up filling out forms. Other practices I’d like to highlight include the action button - the provide direction on the action being completed, form feedback - to prompt users where an error may exist, and minimizing drop down menus are other features I find useful when filling out forms.The <a href="https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/checkout">Old Navy</a> checkout form is one that I find easy to navigate because of the feedback I receive when interacting with portions of the form. It also follows the one column format and provides labels which make it easier to fill out the form.
