        <h2>Visual Game Design Research</h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p> I find it interesting how the author talked about dark-UX. It made me reflect about the concept of UX and how it revolves around improving the experience for the user, but the dark-UX features work more with a revenue focus and encourage mistakes rather than in the benefit of the user. I feel that sliders have been useful in providing visual cues for me as a user and have improved gaming experiences by walking me through a series of steps or opening up a new venue for exploration. I thought it was also interesting how the article mentioned the negative connotation that users associate with the “X” button. It helped me reflect and realize that most pop-ups that I considered “annoying” did tend to have the “X” button and so I can better relate to the point the article is making. I also made note that user decisions should be placed on the right of the screen. I believe a user predominantly is right handed so they have the most accessibility to that side of the screen. In my experiences with the store section in games, I have also found it more enticing to interact with when deals and promotions were most apparent on the page. I found it interesting how the article explained why exactly that works as a way to incentivize users to better interact with the game.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis </h2>

            This image is interesting because of the events leading up to that bowl of ramen and what state of mind and location I was in when eating that meal. That meal was in San Francisco and it was the first meal I was eating in the day, around 4 pm. Because it was not a traditional lunch time, my friend and I could enjoy the entire restaurant and it elevated the dining experience. Something interesting about this bowl is that is a bowl of vegetarian ramen, which isn’t standard for the dish. This image relates to my collection because the collection focuses on experiences revolving around all the images of food. Each of the images of food are eaten in different parts of the country and have a unique story leading up to the dish. The people and memories associated with these meals make them more special than any regular picture of food. This collection tells a story because it speaks about not only my love of good food but also how a memory associated with the meal make it better. I am very interesting in trying new cuisines and love finding new restaurants to explore and try whenever I travel. This series gives a small peak into my travel experiences and how food has played a role in those times.

            This image is a cat and the cat is sitting on wall, staring into the camera. The most interesting components include the action of the cat, the colors in the image, and the location. It seems like this photo was taken during the evening time, based on the lighting, and possibly in the backyard of someone's home. All the tones and colors in the photo seem cohesive and give an ominous feeling to the audience. The cat's tongue is sticking out in the image and it is interesting how that moment might have been captured. The most mysterious is why the cat was sticking its tongue out. I wonder why the cat wanted to leap onto the wall and be in a position where the cat could fall into a dangerous position. The most obvious is the setting of the photo that implies this is at a residential area because of the fence present in the image.

    <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
    <div class="info">
    <p>Looking through the <a href="https://tjda.jp/">Taijuyamashita Design and Architecture</a> page helped me explore combining interactions and images in a unique way. For example, on the title page, I found it interesting that the individual displayed previous of their projects in an carousel that was running without user interaction and got faster when the user scrolled over the images. I really enjoyed how the images were not only on the auto-carousel but also showed portions of the image or had embedded transitions in the previews. This provided a different and dynamic experience displaying more portions of same picture at different times. It was more inviting for me to explore each one of those project and further understand the story. When clicking on these projects, there is a minimal use of words so the images are the spotlight and can communicate the message clearly. The images also show variety in close up and larger spaces which draws attention to different details when looking at the images. Including interactions that prompt the image to fill the screen when the user hovers over it is also a great way to observe the detail of the space easily.

        <h2>Reflection: Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes        </h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p>Overlays can be useful to convey information but it is important to use it in the right and effective ways. The information in the overlay is slightly more visible than the background and lies within a content box. There are three main considerations to keep in mind when using overlays: make sure it is keyboard friendly, there is a way to easily exit the overlay, and the overlay is distinctly different from its background. The main goals of an overlay is to to get users to see content, finish a form, or make decisions. It’s also important to keep in mind that overlays don’t distract from the goal of a page. To avoid getting in the way, overlays often are used in the introductory instructions so it isn’t an interruption. An overlay should also in the direct line of vision for a user so it catches their attention immediately. Another important consideration is how these overlays are visible on mobile devices and taking considerations into account to still make overlays effective.

        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
        <div class="info">
        <p>After reading the article, I was able to reflect on my experiences with filling out forms. I realized myself appreciating accepts in forms that are mentioned in this list because they aided usability throughout the form and motivated me to reach the completion of the form. There are different components within several of the practices that stood out to me as they each served a different purpose in keeping the user’s attention and engagement. Following practices such as minimizing the number of input fields, following a one column layout, signaling the multiple steps within a form through a progress bar, and asking easy question first are all different ways to maintain the attention of users. These practices make it easy for initial hurdles for the user to be avoided and incentivize them to go through the entire form.</p>
             
         <p class="para2"> In my experiences with forms, seeing my progress within the form has incentivized to continue filling it out because I was aware of the end goal and is a practice I follow when making forms.Other features such as distinguishing optional versus required fields, providing formatting requirements, and label placement all provide clear notations and directions within a form to avoid confusion. Confusion is another popular reason by individuals don’t end up filling out forms. Other practices I’d like to highlight include the action button - the provide direction on the action being completed, form feedback - to prompt users where an error may exist, and minimizing drop down menus are other features I find useful when filling out forms.The <a href="https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/checkout">Old Navy</a> checkout form is one that I find easy to navigate because of the feedback I receive when interacting with portions of the form. It also follows the one column format and provides labels which make it easier to fill out the form.
