        <h2>User Testing</h2>

        <p>Project Summary: This project should give you a better understanding of what my experiences look like with these foods.</p>

        <p>Users were given up to 10 minutes to explore the page and make movements that were intuitive to the page. As they interacted with the page, I took notes and observed where users faced difficulties and what questions they had as they explored the project.</p>

        <h3>User Reactions</h3>

        <h4>User 1 - took 5 minutes to explore:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>She noticed the hover feature immediately and noticed the state components disappearing.</li>
            <li>She expected the same disappearing from stars but did not see that pop up and was confused.</li>
            <li>She found the hover confusing because the state immediately popped up so she expected the same for the stars to immediately pop up but realized it was the position of the cursor on the page as she continued to click through the design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User 2 - took 6 minutes to explore:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>He realized the initial hover because of the mouseposition but did not think to explore the stars.</li>
            <li>Until page 3, the stars went unnoticed.</li>
            <li>He enjoyed the images but did not understand directly the context.</li>
            <li>Easily moved through the “next” and “previous” buttons</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User 3 - took 7 minutes to explore:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>After realizing the hover for the state after there being a blank screen, the user took extra time to hover all over the page on all areas that seemed empty. This took extra time and almost took away from the experience when the user was often distracted in efforts of searching through the page.</li>
            <li>They hovered many times over the stars and were confused when it didn’t disappear after hovering like the state image.</li>
            <li>The images took time to understand the visuals and tried to draw connections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Answers to Question</h3>

        <h4>Q1: What did you interpret the stars as?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>User 1: Rating for the Food.</li>
            <li>User 2: Rating for the Food.</li>
            <li>User 3: Rating of the day or the food - a little confused on what it is exactly related to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Q2: Is there any other info to improve the experience?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>User 1: Add more information and captions to provide context for components on the page.</li>
            <li>User 2: Draw attention to the components in ways to prompt the user to interact with them. The initial blank area on the page was confusing and the hover was discovered by chance and not on purpose.</li>
            <li>User 3: Including more pointers to nudge the user in the right direction would help!</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Q3: What is your interpretation of the state and images?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>User 1: The landmarks and the foods you had there but there is a disconnect with the understanding of it being the events in your day. The icons support the image of the state but it does not provide much personal context about your experience.</li>
            <li>User 2: The images with the state did not initially seem like it was related to my personal experiences and instead were at first thought of relating to the place specified in the state.</li>
            <li>User 3: The images were descriptive but it was confusing at first to understand if the visuals should connect with the place or the main image of the food. They seemed like entities that were related but separate from the main food image at first - needed clarification to understand how all the dots connected on the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Q4: Did the project summary match your expectations and experience - what did you think was strong or lacking?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>User 1: It was strong in having descriptive visuals but certain visuals had drawings that incorporated components of other foods that made the experience confusing when relating back to the main goal of the page.</li>
            <li>User 2: There were elements that stood out to me but others that felt missing. There was a disconnect between the smaller images supporting the state image and how those related to your specific image.</li>
            <li>User 3: Mostly, yes! I see how the food makes you feel with the rating provided in the stars but I struggled to gain the full understanding of your experience with all images on each page.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Summary of Findings:
            After conducting user testing, it is evident that I need to improve the user’s experience by providing more context and pointers to nudge them in the right direction to understand the experience I am attempting to convey. I am planning to shift the design to have text that prompts certain behavior from users and will leave less interpretation up to the user. At first, I imagined this interpretation component to be interesting and interactive for the user but I later learned that it was just confusing and lacked the right amount of information to aid their understanding of the pages. The user testing has helped me focus on components that will actively improve the user experience and inspired many changes in my mockups for the final project.
