    <h2>Project Summary: </h2> 
    <p>The project I am choosing to improve and update is my Every Picture Project because I feel that is the assignment I was most intersted in and see most room for immediate improvement.</p>

    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
    <p>
    I plan to focus on improving usability for my Every Picture project. I want to make the process more intuitive since I feel that there are a lot of moving parts in my project but there aren't a lot of ways for the user to know exactly what components to interact with. As a user, I feel there would be a lot of room left for interpretation and questions that a user might have left unanswered when they walk away from the project. I want the experience to feel more targeted for the user and have my experiences be more readily understandable to the audience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="expertfh">Expert Feedback: </h2>
    <div class="expertf"> 
        <p class="para1">I received a lot of productive feedback throughout the process and was able to figure out how to improve usability. The two individuals who I interviewed were in the target audience for my project. They were 21 years old and students who resembled features of those who would be target audiences for my project. I wanted to see their initial reactions to the project and gave them a lot of freedom to play around with the project itself. When leading the usability testing, I introduced my project in one sentence “A flip book providing insight into my favorite food experiences”. After introducing the project in one line, I asked them to keep that sentence in mind when looking through the project.</p>
        <p>I also introduced that I intend to improve the usability of the project and wanted them to provide feedback that would help improve their user experience. When looking at the project, some pieces of feedback I received were having more text to support the images and provide content, specify the location for the user to have more context, and align the transitions for the state image (the changes in the size for the states) so that it is less confusing for the user interacting with the images. Additionally they provided insight into components they wished they could see that would have better met the goal of the introductory statement I led the user testing with. </p>
